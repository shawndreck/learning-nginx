# Personal notes on learning to use NGINX

Reference: https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/nginx/slightly-more-advanced-configurations-for-nginx/

With some experience of Apache but wishing to switch to NGINX,
I decided to take a renewed look at NGINX to demystify it for my own
use. 

This is a repository to keep configurations and notes.
I used linux containers in WSL2 for this setup

* DON'T PUT server block inside /etc/nginx/nginc.conf! *
Rather use separate files with the format `example.com.conf` stored in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/`

## Notes
- Set `server_tokens off` in `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to disable printing out version number of pages such as default 404 etc.

## Hosting Multiple Websites
In NGINX speak, a Server Block basically equates to a website (same as Virtual Host in Apache terminology). NGINX can host multiple websites, and each site’s configuration should be in its own file, with the name formatted as example.com.conf. That file should be located at /etc/nginx/conf.d/.

How to disable a site
If you then want to disable the site example.com, then rename example.com.conf to example.com.conf.disabled. 

Use separate error logs for each server block
When hosting multiple sites, be sure to separate their access and error logs with specific directives inside each site’s server block

- Use `nginx -s reload` after making changes to config

## ABOUT CACHING
NGINX can cache files served by web applications and frameworks such as WordPress, Drupal and Ruby on Rails. 

Create a folder to store cached content:

    mkdir /var/www/example.com/cache/

Add the proxy_cache_path directive to NGINX’s http block. Make sure the file path references the folder you just created in Step 1.

/etc/nginx/nginx.conf

    proxy_cache_path /var/www/example.com/cache/ keys_zone=one:10m max_size=500m inactive=24h use_temp_path=off;

keys_zone=one:10m sets a 10 megabyte shared storage zone (simply called one, but you can change this for your needs) for cache keys and metadata.

max_size=500m sets the actual cache size at 500 MB.

inactive=24h removes anything from the cache which has not been accessed in the last 24 hours.

use_temp_path=off writes cached files directly to the cache path. This setting is recommended by NGNIX.

Add the following to your site configuration’s server block. If you changed the name of the storage zone in the previous step, change the directive below from one to the zone name you chose.

Replace ip-address and port with the URL and port of the upstream service whose files you wish to cache. For example, you would fill in 127.0.0.1:9000 if using WordPress or 127.0.0.1:2638 with Ghost.

```
    /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf
        proxy_cache one;
            location / {
            proxy_pass http://ip-address:port;
            }
```
If you need to clear the cache, the easiest way is with the command:
```find /var/www/example.com/cache/ -type f -delete```

If you want more than just a basic cache clear, you can use the proxy_cache_purge directive.

## Disable content sniffing
Add the following to either http block in nginx.conf to disable content sniffing.

    add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

Content sniffing allows browsers to inspect a byte stream in order to determine the file format of its contents. It is generally used to help sites that do not correctly identify the MIME type of their content, but it also presents a vector for cross-site scripting and other attacks.


## Limit or Disable Content Embedding

Content embedding is when a website renders a 3rd party element (div, img, etc.), or even an entire page from a completely different website, in a <frame>, <iframe>, or <object> HTML block on its own site. 
The X-Frame-Options HTTP header stops content embedding so your site can’t be presented from an embedded frame hosted on someone else’s website, one undesirable outcome being a clickjacking attack

To disallow the embedding of your content from any domain other than your own, add the following line to your configuration:

    add_header X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN;

To disallow embedding entirely, even from within your own site’s domain:

    add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) FilterPermalink

This header signals to a connecting browser to enable its cross-site scripting filter for the request responses. XSS filtering is usually enabled by default in modern browsers, but there are occasions where it’s disabled by the user. Forcing XSS filtering for your website is a security precaution, especially when your site offers dynamic content like login sessions:

    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";


## Adding SSL support

1. Enable/Open ports in server block
2. Create a self signed ssl if none available, using openssl
3. Move the Cert/key pair to a secure location. Example /root/certs/example.com/
4. Set ssl related configurations in http block in the main configuration file
    http{
        ...
        # Set up default SSL TLS configurations
        # Individual configs will be placed in the server blocks respective conf files
        ssl_ciphers EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH;
        ssl_protocols   TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_timeout 10m; 
    }
5. Set ssl cert/key pair in server block

    #File: /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf
    
    #Add certificate/key pair
    ssl_certificate /root/certs/example.com/MyCertificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /root/certs/example.com/MyKey.key;

NOTE:
These alone will not redirect http to https!

## Redirecting All HTTP to HTTPS
add a server block with a return statement to redirect port 80 requests to 
port 443
    server{
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;
        server_name example.com;
        return 301 https://example.com$request_uri;
    }

    server{
        listen 443 ssl default_server;
        ....
    }


## Strenthening SSL configurations

### Enforce Server-Side Cipher Suite Preferences

Web browsers support many OpenSSL cipher suites, some of which are inefficient or weak. NGINX can impose its TLS cipher suite choices over those of a connecting browser, provided the browser supports them.

Add this to the rest of your ssl_ directives, be they in the `http` of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, or an HTTPS site’s `server` block:`
    
	ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

### Increase Keepalive Duration

SSL/TLS handshakes use a non-negligible amount of CPU power, so minimizing the amount of handshakes which connecting clients need to perform will reduce your system’s processor use. One way to do this is by increasing the duration of keepalive connections from 60 to 75 seconds. This is safe for HTTP and HTTPS, so can be added to the `http` block of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or edited if already present.

### Increase TLS Session Duration

Maintain a connected client’s SSL/TLS session for 10 minutes before needing to re-negotiate the connection. Add these to the rest of your ssl_ directives, either in http in main configuration or server block in per domain config

### Enable HTTP/2
Browsers only support this over https
Requires openssl version 1.0.2+
use `openssl version` to check with openssl version you have installed.

To enable http/2, add the following to your server block for 443 port
    listen    443 ssl http2;
    listen    [::]:443 ssl http2;
